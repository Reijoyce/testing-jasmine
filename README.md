Exercises to apply some testing with Jasmine

#Jasmine Wikkipedia:
Jasmine is an open source testing framework for JavaScript.[4] It aims to run on any JavaScript-enabled platform, to not intrude on the application nor the IDE, and to have easy-to-read syntax. It is heavily influenced by other unit testing frameworks, such as ScrewUnit, JSSpec, JSpec, and RSpec.[5]
